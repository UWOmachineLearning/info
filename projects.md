# Active Projects

This is the list of all the projects currently active. 

### Image Simulation

### Lung Cancer Prognostic

"Using a data set of thousands of high-resolution lung scans provided by the National Cancer Institute, participants will develop algorithms that accurately determine when lesions in the lungs are cancerous. This will dramatically reduce the false positive rate that plagues the current detection technology, get patients earlier access to life-saving interventions, and give radiologists more time to spend with their patients.

This year, the Data Science Bowl will award $1 million in prizes to those who observe the right patterns, ask the right questions, and in turn, create unprecedented impact around cancer screening care and prevention. The funds for the prize purse will be provided by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation."

### Realistic Neural Network Playing Video Game
The goal of this project is to create a realistic neural network that learns how to play video games such as Atari games. This will be closely linked to the Deepmind group approach in their [2015 Nature paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14236.html), but will use realistic neural networks instead (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08829).

### Converting a song to a different gender
Creating a model that would take songs and convert them to a specific gender (e.g. metal).

See [DeepBach](https://goo.gl/51pAvD), the generative model that creates its own song inspired by Bach!

# Project Suggestions
This is a brief list containing of machine learning project suggestions.

### Astonomical Objects Detection
Being able to detect and identify astonomical objects such as asteroids, black holes, exoplanets, quasars, etc. 

### Fish Specie Detection (Kaggle)

"The Conservancy is inviting the Kaggle community to develop algorithms to automatically detect and classify species of tunas, sharks and more that fishing boats catch, which will accelerate the video review process. Faster review and more reliable data will enable countries to reallocate human capital to management and enforcement activities which will have a positive impact on conservation and our planet."

### Election Predictions Based on Social Medias

Polls trying to predict elections turn out tend to be poor predictors of actual outcomes. One could use machine learning to harverst the content on the web in order to predict election outcomes in various countries. 


### Recreating Artists' Style

A model could be created that would learn to modify pictures with the style of certain artist. See the following website as an example ;

### Earthquakes/Weather Forcasting 

Weather forcast has always been a scientific challenge and this is even more true when it comes to natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcano eruptions and hurricanes.

# Databases
This is a brief list containing databases that could be used for machine learning.

### 1000 Human Genome Based 

"The available data from the 1000 Genomes Project can be explored on our data page, alongside other data in IGSR. Cell lines and DNA are available for all 1000 Genomes samples and can be obtained from the Coriell Institute. A complete list of the populations available can be found on our Cell lines and DNA page

The samples for the 1000 Genomes Project are anonymous and have no associated medical or phenotype data. The project holds self-reported ethnicity and gender. All participants declared themselves to be healthy at the time the samples were collected."

### Emotion Dectection

One could use labelled pictures or videos in order to predict emotions.
